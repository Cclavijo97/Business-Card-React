**NOTE**: If for some reason you decided to copy the code and try it, is highly possible that it doesn't look like the picture.
This was a first project done in Scrimba which is a coding learning platform. It was a challenge from the course and had to be run there, thus when run on your local IDE is highly probable that it looks weird. That said, at the moment I have no intention on making this code better since I am interested in more advance topic and this was just some sort of introduction to React.
